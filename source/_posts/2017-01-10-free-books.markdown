Recently I realized that github has become for me something, where I can spend hours. It become something what facebook or twitter is for normal people. 
So, I decided to share some intresting repos to save someone's time.
This is incredibly short post. I'll just provide you a repositry where you can borrow something new in computer science/IT/software development.

Just open link and you'll see what value it has. I hope :)
