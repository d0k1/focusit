description: Some words about one jdk tool that shows java process status. Jps tool description

---
This small tool can be useful when someone wants to view PIDs of running JVMs on the host.

#List of JVM instances

Just type ``jps`` and you'll see running JVMs instances.

```
$ jps
17910 Jps
17884 org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.100.v20150511-1540.jar
```

But jps can do more.

<!-- more -->

#List of JVM arguments

``jps -v`` will show command line arguments used to start a specific JVM instance
```
jps -v               
18313 Jps -Dapplication.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle -Xms8m
```

#Main class used to launch JVM
``jps -l`` will tell you what class was used as main to start a java application

```
$ jps -l
19143 sun.tools.jps.Jps
```

Next post will describe jcmd. Tool that can control running jvm instance.
