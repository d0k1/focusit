Hi there!
In this short post serie I'm going to tell you a bit about some use cases of "invisible" tools that JDK comes with. 
I had wondered of fact that many developers don't know anything about invisible power of these jdk tools.
All of these tools aimed to help understanding what is going on in running jvm.

List of invisible tools:

* jps
* jcmd
* jstat
* jstack
* jmap
* jhat

I will write about one tool at a time.

Next post dedicated to jps.
